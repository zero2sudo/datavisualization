### Educational Resource

This project serves as an educational resource for students and developers who want to see how a senior engineer uses Claude Code to build real applications. Feel free to explore the codebase, review the commit history, and learn from the development process.

### For Aspiring SWE Interns & CS Students

Want to supercharge your learning while exploring this codebase? Use this Notion template to track your progress, document concepts, and build a learning journal as you work through the project:

**📓 [SWE Intern Learning Journal](https://ntn.so/sweinternjournal)**

The template pairs perfectly with the `CLAUDE.md` file in this repo, which is designed to help you learn by treating Claude Code as a mentor that explains concepts in context of this actual codebase.
